Installation:
1. Download Zadig and install a WinUSB v6.x USB driver for the Chatbird (Vendor 03EE, Product FF01).
   The latest version of Zadig for Win XP was 2.2.
2. Make sure you have installed Microsoft SAPI 5.1 for the text-to-speech feature.
3. Install Sox (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/).
   I recommend version 14.4.2-win32 of SoX.
4. Open PCParrot.exe - the status should say "USB: Connected" when the Misumi PC-Mascot has been detected.
5. Go to the setting of the PC-Parrot application and setup the path of sox.exe

Hints:
- You can press F11 when editing parrot text to get a live preview
- A saying can be subject to a condition. The condition must be at the beginning of the line and be enclosed in square brackets [].
- When the parrot speaks, the square brackets are evaluated first, followed by keyword expressions in parentheses <> like "<flap>".
